# Projecct Name: OOhw6_GUI
GUI version of Robbie Robot Shop.

# Compilation Instructions:
Open Terminal
Enter the directory labelled RobbieRobotShop_P6
Type 'make'
Type './rrs'

# Use Instructions:
The program is button heavy, each button selection normally opens a new menu, with more features inside. Follows design pattern of a cli but with buttons clicks instead of text inputs.

# BUGS (features):
 - Windows do not close automatically. Program depends on user cleaning up after themselves (closing windows behind them as they advance through menus). This is helpful however, because it allows users to view part description via the "view parts" window while they are making a model.
